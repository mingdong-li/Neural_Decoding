# PointProcessFilter
Point process filter analysis using python. I try to design them like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html#).

And I find a [code repo]((https://github.com/KordingLab/Neural_Decoding)) from [KordingLab](https://kordinglab.com/). So I want to work based on them

## What is point process


## Decoders
### Kalman Filter with Point Process Observation
State-space model with Gaussian approximation [Link][1]


### Particle Filter with Point Process Observation
State-space model with sequential Monte Carlo [Link][2]
